As the airplane moves forward, the engines provide thrust, which creates an opposite force on the air and pushes the plane forward. As the air flows over the wings, it creates an area of high pressure below the wing and low pressure above it, resulting in lift. The amount of lift produced is dependent on the shape and angle of the wings, as well as the speed of the plane.

As Earth rotates on its axis, different parts of the planet are facing the Moon at different times, causing it to appear to move across the sky. When Earth rotates to a position where the Sun is on the opposite side, the Moon is then in its ""full"" phase, and as Earth continues to rotate, the Moon appears to set until it lines up with the Sun and is new again.

Because the Earth is much larger than the Moon, it has a greater gravitational pull, which keeps the Moon in its orbit.

This orbit is what causes the Moon to have phases, as its position relative to the Sun changes. Second, the Moon's gravitational pull affects Earth's tides, causing them to rise and fall. Lastly, the Moon is believed to have been formed from a piece of Earth that broke off during a collision with another object, so it shares some of the same elements and composition as our planet.",9,1,['https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html'],0,31-40,Familiar,Graduate Degree,Man,Very Conservative,White,Suburban Area
