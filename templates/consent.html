                <h4>
                    You are being asked to participate in a research study. Scientists do research to answer questions
                    and discover new information. Some research might help change or improve the way we do things in the
                    future. This consent information will tell you more about the study to help you decide whether
                    you want to participate. Please read this information before agreeing to be in the study.

                <h3><u>Taking Part In This Study Is Voluntary</u></h3>
                <h4>
                    You may choose not to take part in the study or may choose to leave the study at any time. Deciding
                    not to participate, or deciding to leave the study later, will not result in any penalty and will
                    not affect your relationship with the University of Notre Dame.

                    As an alternative to participating in the study, you may choose not to take part.

                    The study is being conducted by Tim Weninger at the University of Notre Dame
                    (email: <a href="mailto:tweninge">tweninge@nd.edu </a> phone: 574-631-6770)

                    This study is being funded by the DOD under proposal w911NF-17-1-0448.

                <h3><u>Why Is This Study Being Done?</u></h3>
                <h4>
                    This study aims to verify how different datasets are used for evaluation. Current evaluation of
                    machine learning models utilize ground truth datasets. We aim to see how people interpret the results
                    of various models and ground truth datasets.

                    article.
